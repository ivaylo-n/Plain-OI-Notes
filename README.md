##  Building a Note-Taking App for iOS 10 with Swift

Programmers typically are tasked with creating two or more versions of an app to accommodate dissimilar devices. These devices all have unique development environments and programmers creating these apps face the task of learning one environment, then another, then another. Since the makers of the platforms cater any instructional material to their product's environment, the challenge of identifying what architecture and code is reusable across the platforms is left to the programmer.

In this course, join Todd Perkins as he takes you through how to create cross-platform apps using Swift. This course is one of three related courses designed to help you discover the similarities and differences that exist between the platforms used by three main devices: an Android phone, an iPhone, and a Windows phone. These courses use the same assets to create the same note-taking app so that you can identify and experience the complementary and contrasting development steps.

######   Topics include:
* Downloading Xcode
* Configuring preferences in Xcode
* Building the app interface
* Connecting interface elements to code
* Writing app logic
